# **Advanced Machine Learning with Neural Networks â€“ TIF 360 (Chalmers University)**  

This course was all about **neural networks** and how theyâ€™re used in **machine learning**. Neural networks, inspired by the human brain, are made up of interconnected processing units that have completely changed the way we tackle problems like **image recognition, prediction, and control**. The course covered key algorithms used today and explored their strengths, weaknesses, and real-world applications.  

The focus was on three main areas:  
- **Recurrent networks (Hopfield networks)** â€“ how networks remember patterns  
- **Supervised learning with deep neural networks** â€“ the foundation of modern AI  
- **Unsupervised learning (reinforcement learning)** â€“ how AI learns without explicit labels  

Beyond just learning the theory, we also got hands-on experience programming these algorithms from scratch and using established ML libraries.  

## **Key Takeaways**  
- Learned the differences between **supervised vs. unsupervised learning** and when to use each  
- Understood the **strengths and weaknesses** of neural networks  
- Implemented neural network algorithms both **from scratch and with ML libraries**  
- Analyzed simulation results and communicated findings effectively  
- Explored the **historical development** of neural networks and their evolution  
- Discussed **ethical challenges in ML**, including bias in AI systems  
- Gained insights into **working in intercultural teams** within the AI field  

## **Course Topics**  
ðŸ“Œ **Neural Network Fundamentals** â€“ McCulloch-Pitts neurons, Hopfield nets, Boltzmann machines  
ðŸ“Œ **Deep Learning** â€“ perceptrons, backpropagation, stochastic gradient descent, recurrent nets  
ðŸ“Œ **Unsupervised Learning** â€“ Hebbian learning, reinforcement learning, radial basis-function networks  

Overall, this course provided a **solid foundation in neural networks**, mixing theory with hands-on coding. If you're into **AI, deep learning, or neural networks**, this was a great deep dive into the field! ðŸš€
